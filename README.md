# CRUD_RESTapi_Operation
This is the simple application to the crud operation on the mongodb and node.js , express.js

// GET :  http://localhost:3000/cruds

// POST : http://localhost:3000/cruds
// PATCH : http://localhost:3000/cruds/<id>

You can Perform all these operation on here. 
Here I have created on model , name crud.js .

This is basically the Schema , where I have added the name, about, problem, underAge. 
and exported to the cruds.js. 

Plese implement it into you local computer to see the full working. 

You can use the above GET , POST , PATCH, DELETE.
